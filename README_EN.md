## ℹ️ Overview

**MindStudio ModelSlim (msModelSlim)** is a high-performance model compression tool in the Ascend ecosystem. It supports quantization and compression of dense LLMs, MoE models, and multimodal models. Developers can quickly tune models through the msModelSlim tool and export models adapted to frameworks such as MindIE and vLLM-Ascend for efficient deployment on Ascend AI Processors.

## ⚙️ Feature Introduction

| Feature Name | Description |
|---------|--------|
| **One-Click Quantization** | Integrates best practices for mainstream large model quantization, supports multiple quantization types such as W4A8, W8A8, and W8A16, automatically matches the optimal configuration, and works out of the box. |
| **Custom Quantization** | Provides a standard integration framework, allowing developers to quickly integrate their own LLMs and multimodal models into the one-click quantization workflow. |
| **Sensitivity Analysis** | Evaluates the quantization sensitivity of each layer from multiple dimensions, accurately locates layers that should be rolled back or have their bit width increased, and provides data support for quantization configuration tuning. |
| **Auto-Tuning** | Automatically iterates and searches quantization configurations based on accuracy targets, automating the entire quantization and evaluation process without repeated manual parameter adjustment. |
| **Weight Conversion** | Performs format and precision conversion on existing quantized weights offline without a calibration set (for example, FP8→BF16, BF16→MXFP8). |

> **Model Support Overview**: For details about the models and quantization types supported by each feature, see [Model Support Matrix](./docs/en/user_guide/model_support/foundation_model_support_matrix.md).
